# JsonPowerDataBaseProject
# Student Enrollmet Form

<br/>This is a project that contains a form for the school students for their enrollemnt in the class's new session. This project is created using html boot-strap and Java-Script and for data storage purposes it uses JsonBasedDB.
<br/>JsonPowerDB is easy to use , faster then other alternatives for database and easily understandable. Even I find it beginner frienldy due to its easy understandibility .
<br/>I came to know about it a few days ago and here I am using it in my project Like a profectional.
